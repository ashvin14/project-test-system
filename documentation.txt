	the Test.The test will not get recorded

9) On admin End admin can login using special account now this account is
   not registered via UI so we have to put it manually in db
   by 
   1)use testSystem
   2)db.usercollections.insert({"name":"ashvin",
   								"emailId":"ash@123",
   								"phone_no.":"87845164",

12)at one instance you can give only one test because 
	'forceNew' is not working as expected
